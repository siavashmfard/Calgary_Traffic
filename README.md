# Incidents Prediction in Calgary 

Calgary is a city in the western Canadian province of Alberta. The city had a population of 1,285,711 in 2019, making it the largest Albertaâ€™s city, and third largest municipality in Canada. According to Statistics Canada, average commute to work for Calgarians is about 27 minutes making it the sixth slowest commute among all cities in Canada. The commute duration may depend on several factors such as roads conditions, urban planning, infrastructure, traffic incidents, etc. According to Statistics Canada, the average fatalities and injuries for Canadian drivers in 2017 are 7.1 and 595.6 (per 100,000 licensed drivers) respectively. Albertans fatalities and injuries in 2017 were 9.5 (fourth place after Youkan, Prince Edward, Saskatchewan, and North West Territories) and 539.4 (eighth place) respectively. Even though Calgary is usually ranked one of the best cities in Canada for driving (or least congested), congestion and traffic remain the top concerns in the city satisfaction survey.

In this report, I tried to study the effect of different variables (e.g. traffic signs, signals and volume) on the traffic incidents in the city of Calgary. Unfortunately, locations of pedestrian incidents were not available on the City of Calgary public database. As a result, only vehicle collisions were studied in this report. Finally, several machine learning algorithms were used to predict the incidents counts in each location grid. RMSE was used as the loss function to evaluate the predictions based on the validation set.
